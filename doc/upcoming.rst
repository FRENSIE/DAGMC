Upcoming Features
=================

Speed enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are working on a number of issues that should translate into run time
reductions for most models.

Installation enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is known that the installation of the DAGMC toolkit can be quite troublesome.
One thing that would make it easier would be to distribute DAGMC as a .deb or
.rpm so it could be installed with a package manager. This would make
installation more straightforward.
