Using DAGMC - The DAGMC Workflow
-----------------------

The following steps are necessary to perform an analysis with most
DAGMC versions of Monte Carlo radiation transport codes. (see below
for more details on each step):

* `Geometry Preparation <workflow/cubit_trelis_workflow.html>`_
* `DAGMC Specific Options <workflow/dagmc_specific_options.html>`_
* `Unified Workflow <workflow/uw2.html>`_
* `MCNP5 Simplified Workflow <workflow/dag-mcnp5.html>`_
* `Fluka Simplified Workflow <workflow/dag-fluka.html>`_
* `Tripoli4 Simplified Workflow <workflow/dag-tripoli4.html>`_
