The DAGMC Workflow
==================

The following pages describe the steps necessary to perform an analysis with
most of the Monte Carlo radiation transport codes supported by DAGMC.

The `UWUW workflow <uw2.html>`_ was designed to make it easier to run the same
problem using multiple physics codes. If you only ever intend to use one physics
code, then feel free to use the code-specific guides.
