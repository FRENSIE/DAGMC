What is DAGMC?
======

The Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo [DAGMC] toolkit is a
component of the Mesh-Oriented datABase [MOAB_] that provides
fundamental functions for the ray-tracing and related geometry
operations of Monte Carlo radiation transport directly on complex 3-D
geometries such as those created in modern solid modeling software.

DAGMC is designed in a modular fashion with the expectation that it
can be integrated into a variety of Monte Carlo radiation tools. The
CNERG group at UW-Madison has been focusing its development on the
MCNP5 software developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory and
distributed through RSICC (in the US) and the NEA Databank.
