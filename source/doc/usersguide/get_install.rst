Getting & Installing the DAGMC Toolkit
----------------------------------------

DAGMC is a toolkit that provides direct geometry support to any Monte
Carlo radiation transport code.  The primary code used for development
and testing of DAGMC is `MCNP5 <http://mcnp-green.lanl.gov/>`_,
developed by `Los Alamos National Laboratory <http://www.lanl.gov>`_
and distributed by the `Radiation Safety Information Computing Center
<http://rsicc.ornl.gov>`_.  There has also been experience with MCNPX
(LANL) and Tripoli4 (CEA/Saclay).

These instructions describe the basic steps for downloading and
installing the software libraries that provide the DAGMC toolkit for
integration with Monte Carlo codes.  After this, code-specific
instructions will be give for each code. For access to the DAGMC
toolkit alone, the following combination of software
packages/libraries is necessary:

* `MOAB/DAGMC <http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/ITAPS/wiki/MOAB>`_
  (SVN: https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/ITAPS/MOAB/trunk)
    * `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html>`_
    * `CGM <http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/ITAPS/wiki/CGM>`_ (SVN:
      https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/ITAPS/cgm/trunk)
        * ACIS v19, or `CUBIT <http://cubit.sandia.gov>`_ v12.2

Installing the DAGMC Toolkit
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following 4 steps are required to install the MOAB library,
including the DAGMC toolkit, for use in Monte Carlo radiation
transport tools.

1. Install `CUBIT <http://cubit.sandia.gov>`_ v12.2
2. Install `CGM <http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/ITAPS/wiki/CGM>`_, using the --with-cubit options
3. Install `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_
4. Install `MOAB <http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/ITAPS/wiki/MOAB>`_,
   using the --with-cgm and --with-hdf5 options (--with-netcdf may
   also be useful but not necessary)

Here are some assumptions/conventions that are used in these instructions:

* all operations are carried out in the a subdirectory ``dagmc_bld`` of a user's home directory
* path to CUBIT files is known, e.g. ``/path/to/cubit``
* all tarballs reside in user's home directory

If these do not apply to you, please modify your steps accordingly.

     *(For a shortcut to installing DAG-MCNP5.1.51 you may be able to use the DagmcBuildPackage .)*

Installing CGM
""""""""""""""

Create a directory to build CGM:
::
    prompt%> mkdir -p $HOME/dagmc_bld/CGM/bld
    prompt%> cd $HOME/dagmc_bld/CGM

    prompt%> tar xzf ~/CGM-12.2.0.tar.gz
    prompt%> ln -s CGM-12.2.0 src

In all cases:
::
    prompt%> cd bld

              --with-cubit=/path/to/cubit  \
              --prefix=$HOME/dagmc_bld/CGM
    prompt%> make
    prompt%> make install

::
    prompt%> mkdir $HOME/dagmc_bld/HDF5/bld
    prompt%> cd $HOME/dagmc_bld/HDF5
    prompt%> tar xzf ~/hdf5-1.8.3.tar.gz
    prompt%> ln -s hdf5-1.8.3 src
    prompt%> cd bld
    prompt%> ../src/configure --prefix=$HOME/dagmc_bld/HDF5
    prompt%> make
    prompt%> make install


Installing MOAB
""""""""""""""""

Create a directory to install MOAB:
::
    prompt%> mkdir -p $HOME/dagmc_bld/MOAB/bld
    prompt%> cd $HOME/dagmc_bld/MOAB

Applying DAGMC to Specific Monte Carlo Codes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Installing DAG-MCNP5
""""""""""""""""""""

If you would like to use DAGMC with MCNP5, known as DAG-MCNP5, you will also need:

* MCNP5.1.51 source code from `RSICC <http://rsicc.ornl.gov>`_
* DAG-MCNP5.1.51 patch file from the UW-Madison

Automatic Installation
'''''''''''''''''''''''

A package has been prepared that includes many of the requires
software libraries and an automated build script.  Because the DAGMC
team is not authorized to distribute `CUBIT
<http://cubit.sandia.gov>`_ nor `MCNP5.1.51 source code
<http://mcnp.lanl.gov>`_, you must acquire those through the
appropriate channels on your own.

Once you have both of those things, you should be able to use the
DagmcBuildPackage to create a working install of DAG-MCNP5.1.51.

Manual Installation
'''''''''''''''''

The following steps are required to install DAG-MCNP5.  Most of these steps are described in more detail below.

1. Install the DAGMC Toolkit as described above
2. Download a copy of the patch file for your version of MCNP:
    * `MCNP5 v1.51 </software/dagmc.patch.5.1.51>`_
    * `MCNP4 v1.40 </software/dagmc.patch.5.1.40>`_
3. Apply the patch your copy of the MCNP5.1.51 source code
4. Build & install the patched version of MCNP5

Some assumptions/conventions:

* all operations are carried out in the a subdirectory ``dagmc_bld`` of a user's home directory
* path to CUBIT files is known, e.g. ``/path/to/cubit``
* all tarballs reside in user's home directory
* MCNP5 source code is available in location ``$HOME/dagmc_bld/MCNP5``

Apply DAGMC Patch to MCNP5 v1.51
................................

Perform the following steps:
::
    prompt%> cd $HOME/dagmc_bld/MCNP5/Source
    prompt%> patch -p 0 < ~/dagmc_install.patch


Build DAG-MCNP5 from modified code
....................................

One of the easiest ways to build DAG-MCNP5 is directly using the
``makefile`` from the command-line.  To do this, you must know the
``makefile`` options to build a version of MCNP5 without DAGMC,
usually in the form:
::
    prompt%> make build CONFIG="seq plot gfortran" FC=gfortran MARCH=M64``

or similar.  Starting from these options, you can build DAG-MCNP5 from
a patched source code with:
::
    prompt%> make build CONFIG="seq plot gfortran dagmc" FC=gfortran MARCH=M64 \
                 MOAB_DIR=$HOME/dagmc_bld/MOAB CUBIT_DIR=/path/to/cubit


If you are less familiar with building MCNP5 from the ``makefile`` you
may want to use the interactive ``install`` script provided by LANL:
::
    prompt%> ./install

Within the ``install`` program you will need to set the DAGMC build options:

* turn on DAGMC mode
* provide the path to MOAB: ``$HOME/dagmc_bld/MOAB``
* provide the path to CUBIT: ``/path/to/cubit``
From the main menu, choose ``C`` to compile.

Your executable should be available as ``$HOME/dagmc_bld/MCNP5/Source/src/mcnp5``.

Tripoli4 is distributed by CEA/Saclay as a binary executable.  For
