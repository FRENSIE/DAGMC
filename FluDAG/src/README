Make Notes 
==========
Makefile should be modified for local conditions.
There are three ways to do this:
1.  Modify the Makefile directory directly by defining 
    local MOAB and FLUDAG locations 
2.  Modify makefile.local, which is include'd by
    Makefile, to define local MOAB and FLUDAG
    locations.  CAUTION:  makefile.local is not
    in the github repository so a github checkout
    will delete it.  Keep a copy outside the github
    directory tree.
3.  Export definitions in your startup script, e.g.
    via bash:
export MOAB=${HOME}/dagmc_bld/MOAB
export FLUDAG=${HOME}/DAGMC/FluDAG
    
Note that you can do a combination of these:  
1. overwrites 2. (if the definition is done after
the call to include makefile.local) and 
2.  overwrites 3. 

Workflow in src to make and run mainfludag: 
> make clean 
> make obj
> make
If it doesn't exist
> mkdir myrun
> cd myrun
> cp ../input/* .
> cp ../mainfludag .
> source runme
This creates a fluka_xxx subdirectory that will be deleted if there are no errors.

CMake Notes
===========
CMakeLists.txt is set up to create a target named "readvol".  To use it, go to 
an empty directory outside of src (e.g. the bin that is parallel to src) and type,
in the case of bin,
>cmake ../src

This will create a makefile that will allow you to type
>make readvol

When complete, there will be a readvol target in the bin directory, along with many
files created by the cmake system.

Note that cmake doesn't care where you are when you run it, you just need to refer 
to the directory that contains the top level CMakeLists.txt.
