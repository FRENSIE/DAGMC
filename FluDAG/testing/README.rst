FluDAG Testing
--------------

Testing for the FluDAG implementation consists of two major components:

1. Interface testing provides test cases for individual geometry
   queries, as they pass through the interface defined for FLUKA in
   the FluGG interface.

2. Integrated testing provides test cases for full physics analysis
   using the FluDAG interface.
