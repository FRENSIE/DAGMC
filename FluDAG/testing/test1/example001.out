  DEFINITIONS
   
  The FLUKA  software  ("FLUKA")  means  the  fully  integrated
  particle  physics  Monte Carlo  simulation  software  package
  being developed since 1989, available from the official FLUKA
  website  (http://www.fluka.org)  and authorised mirror sites.
  FLUKA is made up of FLUKA core code and FLUKA User Routines.
   
  The FLUKA Copyright Holders means both CERN and INFN.
   
  FLUKA User Routines means the set of subroutines collected in
  the usermvax  section  of  FLUKA  and  forming  part  of  the
  standard distribution of FLUKA.
   
  The Licensee  means  any  person acting individually within a
  non-profit organisation, exercising any permission granted by
  this license.
   
  LICENSE GRANT
   
  1.
  Subject to the  terms  and  conditions  of this license,  the
  FLUKA  Copyright  Holders  herewith  grant to the  Licensee a
  worldwide,  non-exclusive,  royalty-free,  source  and object
  code  license  to  use  and  reproduce   FLUKA  for  internal
  scientific non commercial non-military purposes only.
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Licensee shall not execute
  FLUKA in a manner that produces an output whose contents  are
  directly useable or easily employable to simulate the physics
  models embedded within FLUKA in a generic manner,  or  excise
  portions of  FLUKA source or object code,  and  execute  them
  independently of FLUKA.  Extracting specific isolated results
  from any of the individual internal  physics  models embedded
  within FLUKA is not permitted. Permitted use and reproduction
  are referred to below as "Use".
   
  2.
  Modification (including translation)  of  FLUKA,  in whole or
  in part,  is not permitted,  except for modification of FLUKA
  User  Routines that do not  circumvent,  replace,  add to  or
  modify any of the functions of the FLUKA core code. Permitted
  modifications are referred to below as "Modifications".
   
  3.
  FLUKA is  licensed for  Use by the  Licensee  only,  and  the
  Licensee shall not market,  distribute,  transfer, license or
  sub-license, or in any way make available  ("Make Available")
  FLUKA  or  Modifications,  in  whole  or  in  part,  to third
  parties, without prior written permission. The Licensee shall
  not assign or transfer this license.
   
  4.
  Notwithstanding section 3,  the Licensee may  Make  Available
  his Modifications  of  FLUKA User Routines  to third  parties
  under these license conditions.
   
  5.
  The  Licensee  shall  not insert FLUKA code or Modifications,
  in whole or  in  part, into other codes without prior written
  permission.
   
  6.
  Any use of FLUKA outside the scope of this license is subject
  to prior written permission.
   
   
  GRANT BACK
   
  7.
  The   Licensee   shall   in  a  timely   fashion   notify  to
  fcc@fluka.org  any  Modifications carried out by him.  Except
  for  Authors,  Collaborators,  and  employees  of  the  FLUKA
  Copyright Holders, the copyright in whose Modifications shall
  automatically be vested in  the FLUKA Copyright Holders,  the
  Licensee  herewith  grants  the  FLUKA  Copyright  Holders  a
  perpetual,  royalty- free,   irrevocable   and  non-exclusive
  license to his Modifications, with no limitation of use.  The
  Licensee acknowledges that the  FLUKA  Copyright  Holders may
  insert  such  Modifications into future  releases  of  FLUKA,
  subject  to  appropriate  acknowledgment  of  the  Licensee's
  contribution.
   
  8.
  The Licensee  shall report as soon as practical any errors or
  bugs found in any portion of FLUKA to fluka-discuss@fluka.org
   
   
  PUBLICATIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
   
  9.
  The Licensee shall explicitly acknowledge his use of FLUKA in
  any publication or communication,  scientific  or  otherwise,
  relating to such use,  by  citing the FLUKA set of references
  (http://www.fluka.org, see below)  and  the  FLUKA  copyright
  notice.
   
  10.
  The  Licensee  shall ensure that the FLUKA set of references,
  the  FLUKA  copyright notice and these license conditions are
  not altered or removed from FLUKA and that all embodiments of
  FLUKA  and  Modifications  contain  in  full the FLUKA set of
  references,  the FLUKA  copyright  notice,  and these license
  conditions.
   
  11.
  Any insertion of FLUKA code or Modifications,  in whole or in
  part,  into other codes with permission under section 5 shall
  preserve the  FLUKA set of references,  the  FLUKA  copyright
  notice  and  these  license  conditions in the  FLUKA code or
  Modifications concerned, and must also reproduce these within
  any  additional  global  notices included  along  or embedded
  within  the  software  into  which  the  FLUKA  code  or  the
  Modifications have been integrated, in whole or in part.  Any
  part of  the FLUKA code  or  Modifications so  inserted shall
  continue to be subject to these license conditions.
   
  12.
  Publication   of  any  results  of  comparisons  of  specific
  internal physics models  extracted from FLUKA with permission
  under  section 6  with  data or with other codes or models is
  subject to prior written permission.
   
  13.
  Contributions  to  any formal code comparisons and validation
  exercises pertaining to FLUKA, sponsored by recognised bodies
  or   within  the  framework  of  recognised  conferences  and
  workshops, are subject to prior written permission.

  NEGLIGENCE),  PRODUCT  LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING IN ANY
  WAY  OUT  OF  THE  USE  OF  FLUKA,  EVEN  IF ADVISED  OF  THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES,  AND THE LICENSEE SHALL HOLD THE
  COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND ANY CONTRIBUTOR FREE  AND HARMLESS FROM
  ANY LIABILITY, INCLUDING CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN RELATION
  TO SUCH USE.
   
   
  TERMINATION
   
  16.
  This  license  shall  terminate  with  immediate  effect  and
  without  notice  if  the Licensee fails to comply with any of
  the terms of  this license,  or  if  the  Licensee  initiates
  litigation against any of the  FLUKA Copyright Holders or any
  contributors with regard to FLUKA.  It  shall  also terminate
  with immediate effect from the date on which a new version of
  FLUKA  becomes  available.  In either case sections 14 and 15
  above shall  continue  to apply to any  Use  or Modifications
  made under these license conditions.
